- :question: How will I know that you've received my order?
  :answer: Once items have been ordered, a confirmation page will show a summary of
    your transaction. You may choose to print this for your records. An email version
    of this summary will be sent promptly, provided that we have an accurate email
    address. You will receive a subsequent email when your product ships, including
    tracking information (if available).
- :question: How do I know if my items are available for immediate shipment?
  :answer: If the item is not in stock, an inventory status and expected ship date
    will appear as a message in the shopping cart. Delivery time frame for custom
    upholstered furniture is 7-9 weeks, as indicated on the product detail pages.
    Occasionally, we find that an in-stock item is damaged or defective when we fill
    an order – and that getting a replacement for you results in your item becoming
    temporarily unavailable. If this should occur, we'll strive to fulfill your order
    promptly; we'll also notify you immediately. This delay will not incur further
    charges.
- :question: What if an item is on backorder?
  :answer: We strive to maintain inventory on all product. However, if an item is
    on backorder, you will see a backorder message in your shopping cart with the
    expected in-stock date. Occasionally, if we have had unexpectedly high demand
    for an item, we may sell out before the backorder message displays. If this is
    the case, you will be notified via email as to the status of that particular item.
- :question: How do I ship to an address other than my billing address?
  :answer: Simply enter the desired destination on the shipping information page at
    checkout.
- :question: Will I receive all the items in my order at the same time?
  :answer: We ship your items as they are available. If all of the items on your order
    are in-stock and ready to ship, you will receive them at the same time. If an
    item is backordered or delayed, it will ship separately, at no extra charge. For
    your convenience, furniture items are held for a single delivery, shipping when
    all furniture items on the order are available.
- :question: How do I use a promo code?
  :answer: Enter the promo code in your shopping bag to receive a discount on your
    order. Discount excludes Gift Certificates and Art. Not applicable to previous
    purchases. Only one promo code per purchase; not combinable with any other offers.
    Shipping and handling charges still apply. Limited time only.
- :question: Do you ship overseas?
  :answer: We ship to the US and Canada only. We regret that we do not ship to PO
    or APO Boxes at this time.
- :question: Why are orders shipped to some states taxed?
  :answer: Serena & Lily maintains offices in California, Connecticut and New York.
    Our physical presence in these states requires us to collect sales tax on behalf
    of those states. State laws require sales tax to be collected according to the
    address where the merchandise is shipped.
- :question: When is my credit card charged?
  :answer: When you place your order online, we will perform an authorization on your
    credit card to verify that the funds are available. This authorization may place
    a temporary hold on the funds while your order is being processed. The funds are
    withdrawn from your account once the shipment of your order is confirmed. If an
    order that you placed is subsequently cancelled and not shipped, any funds which
    were being held due to this credit card authorization should be made available
    to you again within 2-5 days, depending on your bank’s policies.Please note that
    if you have a backordered item which has not shipped within a week of the original
    order placement date, we may need to re-authorize your credit card prior to the
    shipment of that item once it is returned to stock, to verify that the funds are
    still available. If your credit card is declined or has expired, we will contact
    you to update your payment information. We allow 10 business days with a correction
    or alternate payment method, we regret we will have to cancel your order.
- :question: Which credit cards do you accept?
